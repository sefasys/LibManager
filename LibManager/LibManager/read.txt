## How to Compile, Execute & Run the Project

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Qt Framework** (version 5 or later)
- A C++ compiler such as GCC or MSVC
- A modern C++ IDE, such as Qt Creator (recommended for GUI projects)

### Project Setup
1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local system.
2. Open the project folder in Qt Creator.
3. Ensure all required `.cpp`, `.h`, and `.ui` files are included in the project:
    - `admin.cpp`, `admin.h`
    - `admindashboard.cpp`, `admindashboard.h`, `admindashboard.ui`
    - `authscreen.cpp`, `authscreen.h`, `authscreen.ui`
    - `book_management_fadmin.cpp`, `book_management_fadmin.h`
    - `book_management_fuser.cpp`, `book_management_fuser.h`
    - `library.cpp`, `library.h`
    - `library_database.cpp`, `library_database.h`
    - `librarymanagement.cpp`, `librarymanagement.h`
    - `signup.cpp`, `signup.h`, `signup.ui`
    - `user.cpp`, `user.h`
    - `userdashboard.cpp`, `userdashboard.h`, `userdashboard.ui`
    - `main.cpp`

### Compilation Steps
1. In Qt Creator, click on **File** -> **Open File or Project**, and select the project `.pro` file (if available). If there is no `.pro` file, create a new project and include all source files.
2. Set the build configuration to `Debug` or `Release` as needed.
3. Click **Build** -> **Build Project** or press `Ctrl+B`.

### Execution Steps
1. After successfully building the project, click on **Run** or press `Ctrl+R`.
2. The main application window (authentication screen) will open.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Qt Libraries**: Ensure Qt libraries are correctly installed and included in your system's PATH.
2. **File Access Errors**: Verify the existence and accessibility of required directories (`C:/LibManager/LibManager/` and its subdirectories).
3. **Compilation Errors**: Ensure all `.cpp`, `.h`, and `.ui` files are added to the project.

### Log Files
