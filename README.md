# LibManager
LibManager was a 5 people group project that I contributed. I created the GUI design in QT. It's not a fully completed project so, there are some deficiencies.  
I contributed in many parts in the project.  
I presented the project online to Assc. Professor Muhammed Abdullah Bulbul online. 
We had a great score and this was a stressful project because managing the project and mates in a short period was a hard but very enjoyable part of the project for me.   
Thanks to my group friends, we all tried to do our best.
