# LibManager
LibManager was a 5 people group project that I contributed. I created the GUI design in QT. It's not a fully completed project so, there are some deficiencies.  
I contributed in many parts in the project such as the whole GUI design then helped to code "Signin" and "Signup" parts of the project. Then I helped creating  
"Admin" part of the project.    
I presented the project online to Assc. Professor Muhammed Abdullah Bulbul online. 
We had a great score and this was a stressful project because managing people in a short period was a hard but very enjoyable part of the project for me.   
Thanks to my team, they all tried to do their best.
